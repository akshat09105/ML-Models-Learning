# 🤖 Machine Learning Model Learning | Supervised & Unsupervised

Welcome to my curated repository of **Machine Learning models**, where I’ve built, evaluated, and documented both **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning techniques using Python.

The aim of this repository is to develop a **deep conceptual understanding** of ML models along with practical implementation and evaluation.

## 📘 What’s Inside?

This repo includes clean, well-documented notebooks on:

### 🧠 Supervised Learning
- **Regression**
  - Linear Regression
  - Polynomial Regression
  - Ridge & Lasso (Regularization Techniques)
- **Classification**
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Decision Trees
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)

### 🔍 Unsupervised Learning
- **Clustering**
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Hierarchical Clustering
  - DBSCAN

## 📌 Why This Repo?
I built this repo as a learning journal and reference base to:

🚀 Strengthen my grip on ML model intuition

🧪 Experiment with datasets and hyperparameters

📊 Learn how to evaluate models appropriately

🧱 Prepare for interviews and real-world projects

Whether you're just starting out or revising ML concepts, this repo can help you think in models, not just code.

## 🙌 Final Thoughts
Machine Learning is not just about models — it's about understanding the why, how, and where to use them.

“Every good model teaches you logic, data discipline, and humility.”
